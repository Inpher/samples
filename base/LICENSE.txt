Indemnification.(a) License Indemnification. If a third party asserts a claim against Licensee alleging that software, hardware, content, or data used by Licensee in connection with the Licensed Products, or provided to Inpher in order for it to perform Services, infringes a third party’s intellectual property right, Licensee will defend Inpher against such claim at Licensee’s expense and indemnify Inpher from any damages, reasonable legal fees and costs finally awarded against Inpher (collectively, “Damages”) to the extent resulting from such claim.  Licensee will have no obligation to defend or indemnify Inpher to the extent such claim is based on Inpher’s unauthorized changes to Licensee’s content, data or other information.(b) Inpher Indemnification. If a third party asserts a claim against Licensee that the Licensed Products used by Licensee as permitted hereunder infringes a third party’s intellectual property right, Inpher will defend Licensee against such claim at Inpher’s expense and indemnify Licensee from any Damages to the extent resulting from such claim. Inpher will not be obligated to defend or indemnify Licensee to the extent such claim is based on: (i) combination of the Licensed Products with other software, content, data or business process not contemplated by the Documentation; (ii) use of any older release of the Licensed Products when use of a newer version would have avoided the alleged or actual infringement; (iii) any modification of the Licensed Products made by anyone other than Inpher; or (iv) Inpher’s compliance with any materials, designs, specifications or instructions provided by Licensee. (c) Infringement Remedies. If the Licensed Products or any Deliverable becomes, or in Inpher’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Inpher may at its option and expense and as Licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy: (i) procure for Licensee the right to make continued use of the Licensed Products or Deliverable; (ii) replace or modify the Licensed Products or Deliverable so that it becomes non-infringing; or (iii) terminate Licensee’s license to the Licensed Products or Deliverable and refund a prorated portion of the prepaid but unused fees paid for the applicable subscriptions.(d) Indemnification Procedures. Each party will provide the other with prompt notice of any claim. A party’s failure to provide prompt notice to the other party relieves the party of its obligation to defend and indemnify the other party only to the extent that the failure to provide notice materially harms the party’s ability to defend the claim. The indemnifying party will control the defense of the claim, including any settlement. The indemnified party will provide the indemnifying party with reasonable cooperation in connection with the defense of the claim, and may participate in the defense at its own expense. This Section sets forth each party’s exclusive remedy for any third party infringement claim.10. Term; Termination. (a) Term. This Agreement starts on the date that Licensee enters into an Order or SOW or downloads the Licensed Product, and continues until either party terminates this Agreement in accordance with this Section.

Any Order entered into before the termination of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect for its entire term and this Agreement will remain in full force and effect for purposes of such Order until the termination of such Order, or in the case of perpetual licenses granted under an Order, for the duration of the license.(b) Termination.  If there is no Order or SOW then in effect, either may party terminate this Agreement upon five (5) days’ prior written notice to the other party.  Either party may terminate this Agreement or any Order by written notice to the other party if the other party commits a material breach of this Agreement or the applicable Order and fails to cure such breach within ninety (90) days after receipt of such notice, or an additional period of time as agreed to by the parties.(c) Effect of Termination.  Upon: (i) expiration of a term license to any of the Licensed Products, unless such term license is renewed; (ii) termination or expiration of the license to any of the Licensed Products for any reason; or (iii) termination of an Order, Licensee will immediately cease use of the applicable Licensed Products and delete and/or remove all copies of such products from its servers, terminals and other computer systems and promptly return or destroy all copies of the Licensed Products, Documentation and any other Licensor confidential and proprietary information in Licensee’s possession. If requested, Licensee will certify compliance with the foregoing in writing.(d) Survival.

Miscellaneous. (a) Force Majeure. Except for Licensee’s payment obligations, neither party is responsible from any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes beyond its reasonable control.(b) Assignment. Licensee is not permitted to transfer or assign (by operation of law or otherwise) any of its rights or obligations under an Order or this Agreement without the prior written consent of Inpher, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or denied.

Otherwise, neither party will use the name of the other party in publicity releases or similar activity without the consent of the other party except Inpher may use Licensee’s name in Inpher’s client list.(e) Severance.  If any provision of this Agreement or an Order, or portion thereof, is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be severed and the remaining provisions of the Agreement or Order will remain in full force and effect.(f) Independent Contractor.  Each party will act as an independent contractor and employees of each party will not be considered to be employees of the other party. No agency, partnership, joint venture or other joint relationship is created by this Agreement. Neither party may make any commitments binding on the other, nor may either party make any representation that they are acting for, or on behalf of, the other.(g) Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California without regard to its principals of conflict of laws. In the event of any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, a suit will be brought only in a federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in San Francisco County in the State of California.(h) Verification. Upon ten (10) days written notice, Inpher or its designated third party may verify Licensee’s compliance with the terms of the Agreement and applicable Order at all locations and for all environments in which Licensee uses the Licensed Products. Such verification will take place no more than one (1) time per twelve (12) month period during normal business hours in a manner which minimizes disruption to Licensee’s work environment. Inpher may use an independent third party under obligations of confidentiality to provide assistance. Inpher will notify Licensee in writing if any such verification indicates that Licensee has used the Licensed Products in excess of the use authorized by the Agreement or Order. Licensee agrees to promptly enter into an Order and pay all associated fees directly to Inpher for the charges that Inpher specifies including, but not limited to: (i) any excess use; (ii) maintenance and/or subscription fees for the excess use for the duration of such excess or (2) two years, whichever is less; and (iii) any additional charges determined as a result of such verification.(i) Entire Agreement. This Agreement and each Order and all appendices, exhibits, schedules and attachments hereto constitute the sole and complete agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter, may not be modified or amended except by a writing signed by both parties except as otherwise indicated herein, and supersedes all proposals, understandings, representations, prior agreements or communications relating to the Licensed Products and the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement also supersedes any pre-printed terms contained on any purchase order or similar document issued by Licensee and any such terms will have no force or effect. Neither this Agreement nor any Order will be construed against the party that has prepared such Agreement or Order, but instead will be construed as if both parties prepared the Agreement or Order.
