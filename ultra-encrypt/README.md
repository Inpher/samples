# \_ultra Encrypt Module
The **Inpher \_ultra encrypt module** is a light and simple crypto library designed for non cryptographers. No knowledge on crypto algorithms is required, to be able to use the library. We select the crypto parameters for you so you don't need to do it. This allows any developer to use crypto without making any mistakes that could lead to security vulnerabilities. Furthermore we provide an implementation of **Order Revealing Encryption (ORE)** allowing one to get the order between ciphertexts without decrypting them.
