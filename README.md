# Inpher Samples

This repository contains sample code for the different modules

## SDK

The **Inpher \_ultra SDK** enables applications to encrypt, index, search and share large unstructured data sets without revealing any plaintext to an untrusted host or attacker. Our client-side libraries and backend compatibility empower developers to quickly create secure applications without being crypto experts or changing their search and storage infrastructure.

## Encrypt Module
The **Inpher \_ultra encrypt module** is a light and simple crypto library designed for non cryptographers. No knowledge on crypto algorithms is required, to be able to use the library. We select the crypto parameters for you so you don't need to do it. This allows any developer to use crypto without making any mistakes that could lead to security vulnerabilities. Furthermore we provide an implementation of **Order Revealing Encryption (ORE)** allowing one to get the order between ciphertexts without decrypting them.

## Query Module
The **Inpher \_ultra query module** is a library allowing you to interface with any search engine or document store in a secure way. The library provides easy to use API calls for **inserting**, **deleting** and **searching** documents. The developer can provide a schema specifying which fields of the document should be made searchable and which should be made retrievable. A simple Query String Query syntax allows easy to use and powerful query capabilities.
